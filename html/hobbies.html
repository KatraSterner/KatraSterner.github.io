                    <p>
                        I really enjoy baking all sorts of things but mostly cookies! Heres a picture of 
                        some dinosaur cookies that I made for my sister for a birthday party.

                    <p>I also make:</p>

                    <h3>Arts and Crafts</h3>
                    <p>
                        My main hobby for my freetime is making things, all sorts of things. I used to 
                        draw and paint all the time and that passion for art has developed into much more.

                        Here's an image of one of my recent drawings!

                    <p>
                        Lately I have leaned more towards the "crafts" side of things by making costumes! 
                        This image shows my most recent project that I made for a competition in September. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The costume is of the character Bonnie from the game Five Nights at Freddy's and 
                        I ended up taking home "Best in Show" that day!
