                    <p>
                        I really enjoy baking all sorts of things but mostly cookies! Heres a picture of 
                        some dinosaur cookies that I made for my sister for a birthday party.

                    <p>I also make:</p>

                    <h3>Arts and Crafts</h3>
                    <p>
                        My main hobby for my freetime is making things, all sorts of things. I used to 
                        draw and paint all the time and that passion for art has developed into much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's an image of one of my recent drawings!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lately I have leaned more towards the "crafts" side of things by making costumes! 
                        This image shows my most recent project that I made for a competition in September of 2024. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The costume is of the character Bonnie from the game Five Nights at Freddy's and 
                        I ended up taking home "Best in Show" that day!

            <h3>Media and Editing</h3>
            <p>
                Another way that I like to explore my interests is with media and technology!
                Throughout nearly all of my projects I like to make progress posts on TikTok
                and film clips for making a full-length videos on YouTube. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These videos follow the making of my work and help other people to make something
                similar themselves!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's an example of one of these videos that I made for my YouTube channel 
                about how I made boots for a costume. 
            </p>

                <p>
                I love getting to put things like this together because I get to design a video layout, 
                show how much effort went into the project, and help out other crafters!
